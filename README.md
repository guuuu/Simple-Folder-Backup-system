# Simple-Folder-Backup-system
This system was created in batch and it is really simple to use, you just need to set it up the first time after that you can just run it whenever you want.

First execute Generate Serial.bat
Say how many drives you want to copy to, Ex.: 2
Then say the number of the drives, Ex.: 1 (enter) 3 (enter)
After this, a folder will open, you can double check the text file if you want, but i would just close it right away.

After you set up to what drives you want your backups to go to, it's time to say what folders you want to be backed up, so execute Folder Manager.bat.
Say how many folder you want to backup, it has a max of 5, Ex.: 1
After this, just indicate the path to the folders, Ex.: c:\test\... (enter)

Now execute Set Size.bat and close it when it says to do so.

After all this steps you're good to go, just execute the backup.bat and it will copy the folders you have seted up in Folder Manager.bat to the drives you have choosen.

Note: On the destination drives, you need to have a folder called "Copias", without the quote.

Note2: The program is written in portuguese, you probably wont understand a single thing, but if a big message pop's up something went wrong.

Note3: This was not mainly developed by me, but I was in it too so, here's the github link to the other person who developed the most of this program: https://github.com/darwin1337

Note4: I recommend you to download the whole folder and store it in like drive C or your programs drive, fully set it up, and send a shortcut of backup.bat to somewhere you want it, like desktop.

Note5: Log files and crucial info for the program to work goes to "%appdata%\..\Local\Mvti Systems\" just copy and paste the path into the run prompt (windows key + r) or in the file explorer, or just navigate to it ("drive you have windows installed in" Ex.: c -> Users -> "your username" -> Appdata -> Local -> Mvti Systems), if you can't see some of the folders make sure you have hidden folders to show.

That's it, guess i didn't forget any step ha ha.
